<h1>School project</h1>

<a href="https://david-soliar.github.io/spiral-sort/" target="_blank">RESULT</a>
<p>We had to create a website that would present a unique and simple script that we invented ourselves, written in Python.</p>
<p>The requirements were:</p>
<ul>
    <li>at least 2 HTML documents in which we will describe the functioning of our script</li>
    <li>1 simple Python script</li>
    <li>at least 4 photos that present our project embedded in HTML documents</li>
    <li>the use of CSS and JS was optional</li>
</ul>
